# Bias in Search Engine Ranking Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes bias in search ranking models by using fairness metrics and interpretability techniques. We apply LIRME (Locally Interpretable Ranking Model Explanation) and bias mitigation strategies to improve ranking fairness.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets.
- `src/` - Model implementations, bias analysis, and mitigation.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Install dependencies

Make sure to use python 3.12 with the dev headers included.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
