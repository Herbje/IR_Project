# Bias in Search Engine Ranking Algorithms

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bias in search ranking models by using fairness metrics and interpretability techniques. We apply LIRME (Locally Interpretable Ranking Model Explanation) and bias mitigation strategies to improve ranking fairness.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets.
- `src/` - Model implementations, bias analysis, and mitigation.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
