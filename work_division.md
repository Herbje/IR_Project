Implementation:

Ranking model selection/implementation - BM25, ColBERT, MonoBERT, data processing - Jim
Bias Measurement - Disparate exposure, disparate impact (measure fairness) - Rodin
Interpretability Anaylsis - Implement LIRME inspired techniques - Annabel
Result evaluation - Compare ranking model performance (NDCG, MRR, recall, etc) (measure overall performance) - Yang

Writing:
(TODO)


Bias Mitigation
