Implementation:

Ranking model selection/implementation - BM25, ColBERT, MonoBERT, data processing - Jim
Bias Measurement - Disparate exposure, disparate impact (measure fairness) - Rodin
Interpretability Anaylsis - Implement LIRME inspired techniques - Annabel
Result evaluation - Compare ranking model performance (NDCG, MRR, recall, etc) (measure overall performance) - Yang

Writing:
(TODO)


Bias Mitigation

Note:
First team argument, must report



Bias Measurement: Hypothesis Testing -> One -> Nominal -> Two (Biased vs Unbiased) -> One (Like Gender OR Race etc) -> Continuous -> Logistic Regression or Point-biserial Correlation
